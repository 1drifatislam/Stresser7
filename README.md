## Stresser7
- Stresser with 7-Layers DoS Attack Tool-KID
## HTTP Flood
- HTTP Flood is typically considered a 7-layer (application layer) DDoS attack,
as it targets the HTTP protocol which operates at the application layer of the OSI model.
However, it is possible for an HTTP flood attack to also affect lower layers of the network stack.
## TCP & UDP Flood
- TCP and UDP floods are types of DDoS attacks that target the transport layer (layer 4) of the OSI model. These attacks aim to overwhelm the targeted network or server by flooding it with a high volume of traffic that consumes its resources and causes it to become unresponsive.
